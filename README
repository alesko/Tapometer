Move to src:
>cd src

Pick the right Makefile,
For Linux:
>ln -s Makefile.Linux Makefile

For Mac OS:
>ln -s Makefile.MacOS Makefile

Compile:
> make

Move to from src:
>cd ..

Create a data directory:
>mkdir data

Start the program:
>./TapoMeter 

The program can take the following arguments:
-c x
where x is the threshold to detect a measure
-k x
where x is the multiplication factor, i.e., to register a tap a

Example usage:
./TapoMeter -c 0.05 -k 1.4

The threshold will be 0.05 (anything below will be regarded as noise) and the multiplication factor will be 1.4 (a force above 1.3*c will trigger the tap detection algorithm).
Default values are c: 0.007, k: 1.1

While the program is running type:
+/? to increase the threshold
-/- to decrease the threshold
</> to increase the multiplier
./: to decrease the multiplier
q/Q/esc to quit the program

Look at the data:
>cd data

Open the file (with Octave or Matlab)
